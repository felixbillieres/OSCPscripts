# 🔍 OSCP Recon & Enumeration Scripts

### Welcome to my OSCP Recon & Enumeration repository! 🚀 This repo contains custom scripts designed to automate various reconnaissance tasks for penetration testing, including:

✅ Port scanning & service enumeration (Nmap, SMB, LDAP, MSSQL, etc.)
✅ User enumeration (Active Directory, SMB, LDAP)
✅ Web service reconnaissance (Directory bruteforcing, tech stack detection)
✅ Database recon (MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

⚠️ Upcoming: Pivoting & tunneling automation ⏳

These scripts focus on information gathering and manual exploitation preparation, fully compliant with OSCP exam guidelines (no autopwn or exploitation automation). More features will be added over time!

⚡ Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements! ⚡
